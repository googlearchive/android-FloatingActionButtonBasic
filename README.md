Android FloatingActionButtonBasic Sample
===================================

This sample shows the two sizes of Floating Action Buttons and
how to interact with them.

Introduction
------------

This sample shows how to implement a [Checkable][1] Floating Action Button.

Floating action buttons are used for a special type of promoted action.
They are distinguished by a circled icon floating above the UI and have
special motion behaviors related to morphing, launching, and the transferring anchor point.

Floating action buttons come in two sizes:
the default, which should be used in most cases, and the mini,
which should only be used to create visual continuity with other elements on the screen.

Both sizes of Floating Action Buttons are displayed on screen.
